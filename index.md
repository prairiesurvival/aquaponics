# Welcome

This is starting because [ctdonath](https://twitter.com/ctdonath) said I should after asking if [MorlockP](https://twitter.com/MorlockP) would be including aquaponics in his (yet unreleased) book.

# Goal

The main goal of this log is to document the midwestern basement aquaponics and gardening from a newbies perspective. While both our ancestral families grew up farming, gardening, and hunting for a lot of their food, the last couple generations have not relied on it as much or at all. Instead approaching it like a fresh produce treat for a few weeks a year. Which is understandable when your job doesn't involve plants or animals and living in a city where there's not much time or space to make it worthwhile to maintain a year plus worth of food production.

Because of our work and lives, our strategy for gardening and self food production has been be as hands off as possible. There are a lot of "backyard" gardening bloggers and vloggers out there. But in our experience, they are usually located in more southern and warmer regions of the US, have large land holdings, or are commercial endeavors. So while they might have interesting or good ideas, they aren't that applicable to our situation.

To summerize, we are wanting to maximize crop yield and minimize labor as much as possible.

# Environment

* High ground when compared to surrounding area.
* Loamy soil/former prairie, but higher clay percentage

# Experiments

## First Year Garden

Fresh tilled ~10x25 plot. No border or weed barrier. Planted green beans, peas, lettuce, and beef/mortgage tomatoes. Weeds were aggressive. Tomatoes were largely okay with fruit cracks, but some developed end rot.

Result: A few weeks of fresh produce for salads and a couple jars of canned tomatoes.

## Second Year Garden

Same plot and makeup of plants from prior year, but for the tomatoe plants we burried 12" lengths of 3in pipe straight down in address watering the roots to prevent fruit cracks. Additionally we mixed some calcium into the soil to address end rot.

Weeds while slightly less a problem, were still a problem later in year.

Result: A few weeks of fresh produce for salads and a few more jars of canned tomatoes.

## Third Year Garden

Brother-in-law wanted to make a large extended family garden. He hired a local farmer's tractor tiller to do a ~60x60 plot the fall before. However before the spring, they moved out of the area. Father-in-law helped (well did a lot of the ) planting and weeding. Same crops as the prior years except for tomatoes, plus corn, beats, squashes, and melons were added. No border or weed barriers.

Attempted carboard weed barrier method on smaller original plot, but little success. Crops were tomatoes and lettuce. Cardboard did little to stop weeds in this garden from taking over and a vacation to visit family sealed the deal.

Result: Staggered bean and pea rows allowed for longer fresh produce windows. Several wheel barrows of squash and beets that lasted a good chunk of the winter. Melons, beets, and squash that wasn't eaten was given to the chickens for feed.

## Forth Year Garden

Similar to prior year along with family vacation/weed issues. Added sunflowers and carrots.

Results similar to previous year. Sunflower seeds almost entirely eaten by squirrels.

## Fifth Year Garden

Pregnancy and complications saw little being done.

## Major take-aways

1. Planting from seed in a new garden can make it hard to distinquish between weed and crop.
2. Marking seedling locations is a must.
3. Weed, weed, weed.

## Future Thoughts

* Put border around garden to help prevent creeping weed spread
* Start as many crops as possibe as seedlings.
* Try weed barrier fabrics
* Try mounding, possibly with barrier fabrics

# Aquaponics

We're thinking about starting some basement aquaponics this year. Mainly for the leafy greens or fresh fruit during the winter. Fish are more for the nutrients for the plants than food.

   *For non-commercial systems, favor plants over fish as plants grow slower and corrrections can be made if nutrients are deficient. Where on the other hand, fish die if the balance is out of whack.*
